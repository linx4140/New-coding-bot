    <h1>WHAT IS DRUG ABUSE</h1>
    <img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="">


    <h2>
       Drug abuse and drug menace is the illicit, non-medical use of limited number <br>
        of substances, most of<br/p>
        drugs which have the properties of altering the mental <br>
        state of a being in ways that are considered<br>
        by social norms and defined by statute to be <br>
        inappropriate, undesirable, harmful threatening to the<br>
        life of the user and to the society at large.<br>
         Alcohol, heroin, cocaine, opium, marijuana, are some of<br>
        the drugs abused.</h2><br>


        <h3>
        Generally, the youth seem to be the target of this <br>
        drug menace and its abuse. Curiosity, peer<br>
        pressure, and availability of drugs such as cigarettes <br>
        and alcohol are the immediate causes of drug<br>
        abuse amongst the youth. In the company of bad associates,<br>
         friends are pressured to indulge in the<br>
        use of drugs especially, in the senior high schools.<br>
         On our television stations and on our radio<br>
        stations, there is a “naked” advertisement of alcohol, <br>
        cigarettes and other non-medicated drugs.</h3><br>




        <h4>
        These are harmful drugs that are being presented to be <br>
        good enhancing performance. These drugs<br>
        are even shown to the public as a laxative and the most <br>
        annoying thing is that places where these<br>
        could be bought in large quantities are announced to the<br>
         public. This availability of drugs to the<br>
        youth and the society proves a cause and a cancer to society.<br>
        “Curiosity,” it is said, “kills the cat.” The youth of today are<br>
         very inquisitive and curious. They would<br>
        like to test the efficacy of whatever they see and hear of.</h4><br>
        
        


        <h5>
        this curiosity at times becomes fatal even<br>
        to the point of death. Some by their curiosity go into deal with<br>
         drugs and become addicts. In this<br>
        paper, the author wants to explore the causes, effects and <br>
        control of this menace and also wants to<br>
        highlight the social and cultural aspects of drug abuse.<br>

               WHAT CAUSES DRUG ABUSE?<BR>
Drug abuse causes.<br>
The causes of drug abuse involve different factors that may explain why someone <br>
who abuses drugs has engaged in such behavior around harmful substances. <br>
The causes of drug abuse are listed below.<br>

Accessibility<br>
Social factors<br>
Environmental factors<br>
Mental health conditions<br>
Genetic predisposition<br>
Lack of social support<br>
Curiosity or experimentation<br>



1. ACCESIBILITY<br>
Accessibility is a term used to describe the degree to which a drug is<br>
 easily obtained or used by anyone. In a 2022 survey of 1,000 people<br>
  conducted by the Laguna Treatment Hospital, almost 70% of respondents<br>
   who acknowledged using illegal substances stated they had easy access to them. <br>

Easy access to drugs causes substance abuse by increasing the chances of <br>
a person trying out or experimenting with a drug and consequently abusing it.<br>
 For instance, if you live in a neighborhood where drugs of abuse are often <Br>
 sold in secret, there is a greater chance that you may be offered such substances in your area. <br>

Another example is if a family member takes prescription painkillers,<br> 
which are also often abused, someone who engages in drug abuse may take<br>
 those medications which are not intended for them, or forge or even <br>
 steal prescriptions to obtain a certain drug from a pharmacy.<br>

2. SOCIAL FACTORS <br>
Social factors are determined by various influences, including family <br>
background, education, income, wealth, occupation, or religion, that can <br>
affect someone’s risk for substance abuse. <br>

Some examples of social factors that can contribute to drug abuse <br>
are peer pressure, a desire to fit in, and stress from work or school.<br>
 These social factors can play a role in substance abuse by serving as the <br>
 driving forces that compel someone to use drugs in excess. <br>

For instance, being in a group of friends that experiments with drugs may push<br>
 someone to engage in similar activities due to a desire to please and to avoid<br>
  disappointing other members of the social circle, or to feel included <br>
  and keep up with the group. <br>

Another example is when an individual uses drugs in an attempt to deal<br>
 with daily life stressors, such as additional workload or pressure at school. <br>
 They may start using substances to feel relaxed or even to just temporarily<br>
  forget their problems, without thinking of the possibility that they may <br>
  develop more serious problems as a result of these habits in the future. <br>

3. ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS<br>
In the book Stress: Concepts, Cognition, Emotion, and Behavior, published<br>
 by the Academic Press in 2016, W.R. Avison defines environmental factors <br>
 as social or economic circumstances that influence exposure to stressors.<br>
  They may also be categorized as social roles, social statuses,<br>
   or prevailing social circumstances.<br>

Environmental factors can cause drug abuse by increasing the risk of <br>
one’s exposure to harmful substances, such as drugs. These factors may <br>

include family members engaging in drug use, parenting styles, social <br>
media interactions, and unrealistic depictions of addiction in media. <br>

For instance, children who grew up in an environment where family <br>
members engage in drug abuse are exposed to substance use early in <br>
life, and are therefore more likely to adopt the behavior in adulthood. <br>

Many series, movies, or other forms of media have attempted to <br>
portray addiction but only end up with unrealistic depictions<br>
 that border on glorifying addictive behaviors. One example is <br>
 the movie Wolf of Wall Street (2013), where Leonardo DiCaprio<br>
  plays scamming stockbroker Jordan Belfort.<br>

According to a 2018 article from SBS (Special Broadcasting Service)<br>
 entitled, “The most (and least) accurate depictions of drug <br>
 addiction onscreen,” during a scene where Belfort tried crack,<br>
  his personality suddenly shifted into a party animal, where <br>
  in reality a strong substance like crack would cause someone<br>
   to initially be overwhelmed with such drastic changes that <br>
   the drug can cause in their state of mind.<br>

4. MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION<br>
Mental health conditions are clinically significant disruptions <br>

in a person’s ability to think, regulate their emotions, or behave<br>
, according to a fact sheet on mental disorders from<br>
 the World Health Organization. <br>

Psychological disorders can cause drug abuse by increasing<br>
 the likelihood of an individual to self-medicate using legal<br>
  or illegal substances. However, an article entitled,<br>
   “Substance Use and Co-Occurring <br>
   Mental Disorders” from the National Institute of Mental <br>
   Health (NIH) states that although some medications may temporarily<br>
    alleviate some symptoms of mental problems, they may exacerbate the symptoms over time.<br>

For instance, an individual suffering from depression may turn to<br>
 substances that can cause relaxation or numb pain, such as alcohol <br>
 or prescription drugs, to change their mood, face their fears, <br>
 
 or cope with unpleasant emotions.  <br>

On the other hand, someone dealing with uncomfortable emotions and terrifying <br>
memories because of a past traumatic event may also use recreational drugs, <br>
such as marijuana or stimulants, to relieve the stress associated with their situation.<br>

5. GENERIC PREDISPOSITION<br>
A genetic predisposition means that a person has a higher probability of <br>
developing an illness based on their genetic makeup, according to an article<br>
 entitled, “What does it mean to have a genetic predisposition to a disease?” from medline Plus.<br>

Genetic predisposition stems from specific genetic differences, <br>
which are frequently inherited from one’s parents. It can cause drug <br>
abuse by influencing the amount and types of receptors in a person’s brain, <br>
the rate at which their bodies metabolize drugs, and how effectively they<br>
 respond to particular medications. <br>

For instance, according to a 2019 article entitled, “Genetics: The Blueprint of Health and Disease,”<br>
 from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, family studies involving identical <br>
 
 twins, fraternal twins, adoptees, and siblings reveal that a person’s <br>
 genetic composition may account for up to half of his or her risk of <br>
 being addicted to nicotine, alcohol, or other drugs.<br>

6. LACK OF SOCIAL SUPPORT<br>
OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) data <br>
states that a lack of social support reflects the percentage of <br>
people who say they don’t have any friends or family members <br>
they can count on in hard times. <br>

Having no social support can play a role in drug abuse by <br>
contributing to emotional distress due to a lack of connection <br>
with other people, which may lead someone to connect with <br>
anything around them – including drugs.<br>

For instance, a 2019 study on the inverse relationship between perceived <br>
social support and substance use frequency in socially stigmatized <br>

populations published in Addictive Behaviors Reports found that in a <br>
sample involving prisoners, higher lifetime alcohol, cannabis, and <br>
tobacco usage is associated with lower social support. <br>

7. CURIOSITY OR EXPERIMENTATION
Experimentation means that someone might experiment with drugs <br>
out of curiosity about their effects or to blend in with their peers. <br>
Drug use is often minimal during the experimental phase.<br>

Experimenting with drugs can cause substance abuse later in life by <br>
leaving lasting changes on a teenager or young adult’s brain, which <br>
still continues to experience rapid changes at an early age. During <br>
this time, an underdeveloped brain is more likely to learn and rely <br>
on the rewarding effects of drugs, heightening the risk of drug abuse.<br> 

One example is when a teenager attends a school where drugs are being <br>
used, sold, or kept. This increases the likelihood of them personally <br>
knowing a classmate or schoolmate who sells drugs and subsequently <br>
experimenting with those illicit substances.<br>

               NOTE:<BR>
               PREVENT DRUG ABUSE THROUGH EDUCATION AWAERNESS, HEALTHY COPING <BR>

               AVOID PEER PRESSURE AND SUBSTANCE EXPOSURE<BR>
